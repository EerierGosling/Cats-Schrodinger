# Cat's Schrödinger

Made during the GMTK Game Jam 2023 ([itch.io page](https://itsmenoobieboy.itch.io/cats-schrodinger)), this game seeks to reverse the traditional roles in the famous thought experiment Schrödinger's cat. The thought experiment depicts a situation in quantum physics where particles can be in a superposition of all possible states at once until they are observed. You are playing as the cat, and each time an event has a probability of occurring, the timeline splits into two realities: one where the event did happen and one where it did not. Since you, the cat, are not being observed, you can exist in a superposition of all the timelines and jump between them at will.
